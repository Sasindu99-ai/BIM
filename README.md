## 📘 Abstract

This research proposes a brain-inspired model (BIM) designed to perform real-time, multimodal sensory processing with adaptive learning capabilities. The model aims to process and integrate inputs from various sensory sources—such as images, audio, and text—enabling dynamic, context-aware, and interactive AI systems. Potential applications include robotics, healthcare, and human-computer interaction, where systems must learn and operate autonomously in dynamic environments.

## 🧩 Research Motivation

Despite rapid advancements in AI, most models remain task-specific and lack the adaptability of biological intelligence. The human brain’s ability to integrate sensory inputs and adapt to new information offers a powerful blueprint. Inspired by this, the proposed BIM seeks to:

- Integrate real-time sensory inputs  
- Emulate memory and learning mechanisms  
- Interact contextually and autonomously
